SFS Notes, Version 1

Overview

    See README for an overview of SFS.

SFS Host Configuration

    SFS supports being built on a Linux server for testing.

    If the environment variable CROSS_COMPILE is not set, the build
    will be done on the host.  The resulting command image is called
    sfsctl-test and is copied to the top level of the sfs source
    directory.  Build directories for host and embedded targets are
    maintained separately.

    The flash system is mimicked by keeping a file _fake_flash in the
    local directory.  This can be inspected with od or another utility
    as needed.  All sfsctl commands work in this environment.

Changing Parameters

    Noting that backwards compatibility with existing file systems
    will require significant changes to the code, you can change the
    basic parameters by adjusting the following defines:

    In sfs.h:

        SFS_FILES_MAX:          Number of files in FS
        SFS_FILENAME_MAX:       Length of filename

    In sfs_host.h and/or sfs_lb4g.h:

        SFS_DEFAULT_OFFSET:     Default location in flash of the SFS
        SFS_ALLOC_BYTES:        Total size of an SFS in flash
        SFS_FLASH_BYTES:        Total size of the flash system

Porting to Different Flash

    After adjusting the parameters above as necessary, you can add new
    flash read and write routines by copying the format of
    lb4g_flash_read/write or fake_flash_read/write and calling
    sfs_config with those routines.

Internals

    There is a header with a 32-bit CRC that contains the file control
    blocks as a fixed array.  Each file control block contains a CRC
    for the file data, an offset in to the filesystem and a length.
    Lengths should be 16-byte aligned.
